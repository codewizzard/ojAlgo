oj! Algorithms - ojAlgo - is Open Source Java code that has to do with mathematics, linear algebra and optimisation.

## High Performance on a Rich Feature Set with Zero Dependencies

- ojAlgo is the fastest pure Java linear algebra library available. That statement is backed by the latest Java Matrix Benchmark results – that’s a third party independent benchmark (not written by anyone associated with ojAlgo). 
- Optimisation (mathematical programming) tools including LP, QP and MIP solvers – again this is pure Java with zero dependencies.
- A collection of “array” classes that can be sparse or dense and arbitrarily large. They can be used as 1-, 2- or N/Any-dimensional arrays, and may contain/handle a multitude of different number types including complex numbers, rational numbers and quaternions. The memory for the arrays can alternatively be allocated off heap or in a file. The linear algebra part of ojAlgo builds on these arrays – they’re fast and efficient.
- A growing collection of utilities for data science, including Artificial Neural Networks and a collection of tools for reading/writing/processing data
- Various other things like time series, random numbers, stochastic processes, descriptive statistics…
